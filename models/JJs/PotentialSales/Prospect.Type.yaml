summary: A potential sale opportunity
description: >
  A potential sale refers to a prospective transaction or business opportunity where there is an 
  expressed interest or likelihood that a product or service may be purchased by a customer or client. 
  This typically involves leads or inquiries that have shown some level of engagement, but the sale 
  has not yet been finalized or converted. Potential sales are key indicators in the sales pipeline, 
  representing opportunities that require further nurturing, follow-up, and negotiation to convert into actual sales.
